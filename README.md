## the movement (using Q matrix)
Then, the program will print out each step of movement (it will chose the best move according to the Q-matrix ):
```

## Solve other initial state
At last, the program will ask you to input other initial state:
```
your state(a,b,c):
```
And it will print out the best movement according to the Q-matrix it just learnt:
```
your state(a,b,c): 1,0,2
